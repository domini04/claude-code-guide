# Claude Code Learning Project

## Project Overview

**Purpose**: Learning environment for exploring Claude Code features, workflows, and professional best practices.

**Based on**: Boris Cherny's (Claude Code creator) setup and professional workflows from January 2026.

## Project Structure

This is a practice directory for experimenting with Claude Code features:
- `.claude/` - Configuration files for Claude Code
  - `settings.local.json` - Local permissions and settings
  - `commands/` - Custom slash commands (to be created)
- Learning materials and experiments will be organized as needed

## How to Work on This Project

### Experimentation Focus
- This is a **learning project** - feel free to experiment and try different approaches
- Document learnings and mistakes to build knowledge over time
- Test features in isolation before combining them

### Learning Priorities
1. Master Plan Mode (Shift+Tab twice) before making changes
2. Create verification loops for quality (aim for 2-3x improvement)
3. Build up custom commands and hooks incrementally
4. Share learnings by updating this file

### Key Commands
- Use `/help` to explore available commands
- Use `/permissions` to manage allowed operations
- Press `#` during work to suggest additions to this file

## Best Practices to Follow

### Progressive Learning
- Start with basics (Plan Mode, verification) before advanced features
- Master one feature before adding complexity
- Document what works and what doesn't

### Verification First
- IMPORTANT: Always give Claude a way to verify its work
- Test changes immediately after implementation
- Build feedback loops into workflows

### Keep This File Updated
- Add new learnings as you discover them
- Remove outdated instructions
- Keep it concise and universally applicable
- Focus on WHAT (tech/structure), WHY (purpose), and HOW (workflow)

## Notes

- Model preference: Opus 4.5 with thinking mode (better tool use, less steering)
- This file should grow organically as you learn
- Maximum ~300 lines to stay within instruction limits
