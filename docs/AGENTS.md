# AGENTS.md - Documentation

## Purpose
Learning materials for Claude Code features and workflows.

## Behavior Guidelines
- READ existing docs before suggesting changes to match style
- PRESERVE numbered order (00-09) - reflects learning progression
- UPDATE docs/README.md when adding new files
- KEEP each doc focused on ONE topic
- USE practical examples, not abstract theory

## Structure
- 00-02: Foundation (overview, CLAUDE.md, Plan Mode)
- 03-06: Essential features (commands, hooks, permissions, verification)
- 07-09: Advanced topics (MCP, parallel sessions, collaboration)

## Verification
- Check relative paths in markdown links
- Match terminology with other docs
- Ensure examples are runnable
